      <h1>Introduction</h1>

      <p>I'm a full-stack web developer with experience using Angular, Django and React</p>
      
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>
        Originally born in Central Florida, I would later move to Tallahassee and begin 
        self-directed study of HTML before the age of 11 and enrolling in the necessary 
        classes a few years later to obtain a Cisco Web Design Certification
        before graduating High School. In college, I would make the "Linux Leap," integrating
        into the Ubuntu and open source ecosystems, learning C++ and attending FSU for Computer
        Science

      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>
          My favorite hobbies often involve solving logic problems and/or building things:
          <ul>
            <li>Magic: The Gathering</li>
            <li>Game Programming/Development</li>
            <li>Building Automation Tools</li>
            <li>Coding Challenges</li>
          </ul>
          Showing up to a coding meetup "for fun" can garner some strange reactions
      </p>
      
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>
        Full-Stack Web Developer. It's been too much work for it to be anything else
      </p>
      
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>
        Today I live in Denver, CO. A city
      </p>
      
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>
        I want to help modernize the world and believe the ability of websites and web apps to
        do that have now exceeded that in a way that standalone software can, for now,
        not hope to achieve
